# HORA Q — Architecture Decision Records

> Purpose: Rationale behind major initial choices.

## Scope and intent

This document explains the architecture decision records area for HORA Q, the Explainable BGP Origin and Subprefix Anomaly Monitor.
The project is associated with AIORI-3, Track 2 Cyber Security, problem PS-005, team A3-PS005-TC416.
Treat this document as engineering guidance that must be checked against the actual source and runtime environment.
Do not present a planned capability as implemented or a described test as passed unless evidence exists.

## FastAPI

Chosen for typed request validation and automatic OpenAPI docs; validate dependencies and runtime behavior.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## SQLite

Chosen for easy local persistence; revisit for concurrency or data volume needs.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Opt-in collector

Chosen to keep offline development possible and avoid unvalidated live parsing by default.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Fixed baseline

Chosen to avoid silently accepting a changed origin; requires future reviewed promotion.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Deterministic rules

Chosen for explainability and repeatability; limited coverage must be acknowledged.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Hash plus optional signature

Chosen to separate integrity checking from signer authentication.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Synthetic scenarios

Chosen for reproducible tests without waiting for live incidents.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Trade-offs

Every decision should include context, consequences, validation, and revisit criteria.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Review

Update records when implementation materially diverges from the decision.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Evidence

Use tests and measurements to validate decisions rather than relying on rationale alone.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Practical review checklist

- Confirm cryptographic hashes are distinguished from signatures.

## Maintenance

Keep this document aligned with code, tests, dependencies, and deployment instructions.
When the system changes, review this document together with the related acceptance tests.
Record unresolved assumptions and avoid claims that exceed the verified implementation.
