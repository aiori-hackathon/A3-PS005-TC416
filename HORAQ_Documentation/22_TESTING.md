# HORA Q — Testing Strategy

> Purpose: Unit, integration, API, frontend, and acceptance testing.

## Scope and intent

This document explains the testing strategy area for HORA Q, the Explainable BGP Origin and Subprefix Anomaly Monitor.
The project is associated with AIORI-3, Track 2 Cyber Security, problem PS-005, team A3-PS005-TC416.
Treat this document as engineering guidance that must be checked against the actual source and runtime environment.
Do not present a planned capability as implemented or a described test as passed unless evidence exists.

## Layers

Use unit, service, API, integration, frontend, end-to-end, and manual acceptance tests.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Normalization

Test IPv4, IPv6, host-bit normalization, malformed prefixes, ASN boundaries, and timestamps.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Detector

Test baseline seeding, same-origin observations, changed origin, strict child prefix, equal prefix, and unrelated prefix.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Persistence

Test restart persistence, transaction rollback, and isolation between test databases.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Evidence

Test deterministic serialization, matching hash, modified-record mismatch, and missing digest.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Crypto

Test provider status, valid signature, altered record, wrong key, malformed data, and unavailable provider.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Collector

Use sanitized message fixtures for supported events, withdrawals, malformed JSON, and missing fields.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## RPKI

Mock success, timeout, HTTP error, malformed response, and unknown status.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## API

Test validation status codes, missing records, bounded limits, and stable response shapes.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Frontend

Test view rendering, scenario actions, API errors, and unavailable crypto.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## CI

Run backend tests and frontend production build for each proposed change.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Exit criteria

Record actual commands, pass/fail counts, skipped tests, and tested commit hash.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Practical review checklist

## Maintenance

Keep this document aligned with code, tests, dependencies, and deployment instructions.
When the system changes, review this document together with the related acceptance tests.
Record unresolved assumptions and avoid claims that exceed the verified implementation.
