# HORA Q — RIPEstat RPKI Context

> Purpose: Origin-validation status and external API behavior.

## Scope and intent

This document explains the ripestat rpki context area for HORA Q, the Explainable BGP Origin and Subprefix Anomaly Monitor.
The project is associated with AIORI-3, Track 2 Cyber Security, problem PS-005, team A3-PS005-TC416.
Treat this document as engineering guidance that must be checked against the actual source and runtime environment.
Do not present a planned capability as implemented or a described test as passed unless evidence exists.

## Purpose

Add origin-validation context to a route investigation.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Endpoint

Use the current RIPEstat API documentation for the RPKI validation endpoint and response schema.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Request

Supply normalized prefix and origin ASN and use a bounded timeout.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Valid

A valid result generally indicates available ROA data authorizes the origin and prefix length.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Invalid

An invalid result indicates a conflict with available authorization data.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Unknown

Unknown or not-found means matching authorization data was not found in the response.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Unavailable

Timeouts, network errors, HTTP errors, and malformed responses must remain unavailable.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Limits

RPKI origin validation does not validate the entire AS path or establish intent.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Correlation

Keep route observation time separate from RPKI lookup time.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Caching

Add caching and rate-limit handling only with a documented freshness policy.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Tests

Mock provider success, timeout, malformed JSON, missing status, and unrecognized status.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Practical review checklist

## Maintenance

Keep this document aligned with code, tests, dependencies, and deployment instructions.
When the system changes, review this document together with the related acceptance tests.
Record unresolved assumptions and avoid claims that exceed the verified implementation.
