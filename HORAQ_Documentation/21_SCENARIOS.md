# HORA Q — Synthetic Scenarios and Replay

> Purpose: Reproducible scenarios and expected outcomes.

## Scope and intent

This document explains the synthetic scenarios and replay area for HORA Q, the Explainable BGP Origin and Subprefix Anomaly Monitor.
The project is associated with AIORI-3, Track 2 Cyber Security, problem PS-005, team A3-PS005-TC416.
Treat this document as engineering guidance that must be checked against the actual source and runtime environment.
Do not present a planned capability as implemented or a described test as passed unless evidence exists.

## Purpose

Exercise detector behavior without waiting for a live incident.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Labeling

Every synthetic observation must be visibly identified as synthetic.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Baseline

Submit a known prefix and ASN; expect baseline creation without an origin-change alert.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Origin change

Submit one ASN then a different ASN for the same prefix; expect an origin-change alert.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Subprefix

Submit a parent then a strict child; expect a more-specific alert.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Migration

Submit a changed origin with a migration scenario label; the detector still reports a change without claiming intent.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Fresh state

Use a dedicated test database or explicit reset strategy for deterministic expectations.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Fixtures

Record expected alert kinds, prefixes, ASNs, and evidence fields.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Replay

Validate replay input, preserve timestamps and source labels, and avoid overwriting production data.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Evaluation

Use labeled datasets for precision/recall; synthetic scenario counts alone do not establish real-world quality.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Acceptance

Scenario results should be repeatable and saved with commit and environment details.

For this area, preserve source provenance and timestamps wherever relevant.
Validate inputs and represent errors explicitly instead of silently inventing a result.
Keep the behavior explainable and add tests for both normal and failure paths.
Update related API examples and documentation when behavior changes.

## Practical review checklist

## Maintenance

Keep this document aligned with code, tests, dependencies, and deployment instructions.
When the system changes, review this document together with the related acceptance tests.
Record unresolved assumptions and avoid claims that exceed the verified implementation.
